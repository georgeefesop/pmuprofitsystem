## Introduction

This test plan outlines the approach for verifying that removing unused and redundant files from the PMU Profit System codebase doesn't break functionality. The plan includes tests for core functionality, as well as specific tests for each category of files to be removed or consolidated.

## Test Environment Setup

### Local Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up the local development environment with `npm run setup`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Verify that the application loads without errors

### Test Database

1. Use a separate test database for testing
2. Populate the test database with sample data
3. Create test users with various roles and permissions

### Test Users

Create the following test users:
- Admin user with full access
- Regular user with a purchase
- Regular user without a purchase
- New user who hasn't completed the signup process

## Core Functionality Tests

### Authentication Tests

1. **User Registration**
   - Test creating a new user account
   - Verify email verification flow
   - Verify redirect to appropriate page after registration

2. **User Login**
   - Test login with valid credentials
   - Test login with invalid credentials
   - Verify redirect to appropriate page after login
   - Verify "Remember Me" functionality
   - Verify "Forgot Password" functionality

3. **User Logout**
   - Test logout functionality
   - Verify redirect to appropriate page after logout
   - Verify session is properly terminated

4. **Protected Routes**
   - Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
   - Verify that authenticated users can access protected routes
   - Verify that users without purchases are redirected to checkout

### Checkout Tests

1. **Product Selection**
   - Verify that products can be selected
   - Verify that product information is displayed correctly

2. **Checkout Process**
   - Test the complete checkout flow
   - Verify that payment information is collected correctly
   - Verify that payment is processed correctly
   - Verify that purchase records are created correctly
   - Verify redirect to success page after checkout

3. **Checkout Success**
   - Verify that success page displays appropriate information
   - Verify that user can navigate to dashboard after checkout

### Dashboard Tests

1. **Dashboard Access**
   - Verify that authenticated users with purchases can access the dashboard
   - Verify that authenticated users without purchases are redirected to checkout

2. **Dashboard Content**
   - Verify that dashboard displays appropriate content
   - Verify that user information is displayed correctly
   - Verify that purchased products are displayed correctly

3. **Dashboard Navigation**
   - Verify that user can navigate between dashboard pages
   - Verify that sidebar links work correctly

## Testing Removal of Duplicate Files

### Authentication Context

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document which files import from `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Verify that authentication works correctly

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Update imports to use `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Verify that authentication still works correctly
   - Test login, logout, and protected routes
   - Verify that user information is still displayed correctly

### Section Components

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document which files import from `src/components/sections/FeaturesSection.tsx`
   - Verify that features section displays correctly

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove `src/components/sections/FeaturesSection.tsx`
   - Update imports to use `src/components/sections/features.tsx`
   - Verify that features section still displays correctly

### User Management Scripts

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document the functionality of `scripts/delete-test-users.js` and `scripts/remove-test-users.js`
   - Test both scripts to verify their functionality

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove `scripts/remove-test-users.js`
   - Verify that `scripts/delete-test-users.js` still works correctly
   - Verify that test users can still be deleted

## Testing Removal of Redundant Pages

### Register Page

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document the functionality of `src/app/register/page.tsx`
   - Verify that registration works through this page
   - Document any links to this page

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove `src/app/register/page.tsx`
   - Update any links to point to `src/app/signup/page.tsx`
   - Verify that registration still works through the signup page
   - Verify that all links that previously pointed to register now point to signup

## Testing Removal of Test Pages

### Test and Diagnostic Pages

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document the functionality of each test and diagnostic page
   - Verify that these pages are not linked from production pages

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove test and diagnostic pages
   - Verify that the application still works correctly
   - Verify that no production functionality is affected

### Test API Routes

1. **Before Removal**
   - Document the functionality of each test API route
   - Verify that these routes are not used by production code

2. **After Removal**
   - Remove test API routes
   - Verify that the application still works correctly
   - Verify that no production functionality is affected

## Testing Script Consolidation

### Development Scripts

1. **Before Consolidation**
   - Document the functionality of each development script
   - Test each script to verify its functionality

2. **After Consolidation**
   - Consolidate development scripts
   - Verify that all functionality is preserved
   - Test the consolidated scripts to verify they work correctly

### Testing Scripts

1. **Before Consolidation**
   - Document the functionality of each testing script
   - Test each script to verify its functionality

2. **After Consolidation**
   - Consolidate testing scripts
   - Verify that all functionality is preserved
   - Test the consolidated scripts to verify they work correctly

## Regression Testing

### End-to-End Tests

1. **User Journey Tests**
   - Test the complete user journey from registration to dashboard
   - Verify that all steps work correctly

2. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test error handling for various scenarios
   - Verify that errors are handled gracefully

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test application performance before and after changes
   - Verify that performance is not degraded
