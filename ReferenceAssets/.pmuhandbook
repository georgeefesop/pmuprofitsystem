Get Ready to Level Up: As you go through this course, think about where your business stands today and where you want it to be in the next 6 to 12 months. This is your opportunity to take charge and create a business that not only supports your lifestyle but also gives you the freedom and financial security you deserve.
Disclaimer!
This is NOT an ‘easy’ business. In fact, I would say that no business is easy to run. If you’re looking for easy, I would recommend getting a desk job because it’s not for the faint of heart. There will be challenges and disappointments. You’ll have to deal with all the ins and outs of running a business if you intend to take this seriously but I promise that in the end if you apply yourself and take it steady you can absolutely make €5k a month and more and we are going to show you exactly how we do it. 
Now, let's get started.

Analysis of realistic earning potentials 
In this section, we'll break down the potential earnings you can expect as a solo PMU artist, whether you're working part-time or full-time. These calculations include time dedicated to administrative tasks, marketing, and client management, which are essential for maintaining and growing your business.
The figures provided are based on our own experience at Motiv Ink Beauty in Limassol, Cyprus. Your figures may vary considerably depending on the current competition for these services in your area.

Your experience, reputation and the quality of your work will also have some impact on what you’re able to charge as well.

Key Points:
Part-Time Earnings: Working 20 hours per week, with 4 hours dedicated to admin tasks, can generate around €3,960 per month. This includes 3 first-time appointments and 3 touch-ups per week, along with 3 consultations.


€5000 / month : At the prices we’re suggesting €250 for first time appointments and €80 for touch ups you would only need 4 of each per week to make over €5000 / month which is entirely do-able. 

(4x250 = 1000) + (4x80 = 320) = 1320
1320 x 4 weeks = €5280 per month


Full-Time Earnings: Committing to 40 hours per week, with 8 hours dedicated to admin tasks, increases your potential income to €7,920 per month. This includes 6 first-time appointments and 6 touch-ups per week, along with 6 consultations.

Considerations:
Time Management: These calculations assume that a portion of your week is dedicated to non-client tasks such as marketing, replying to messages, photo editing, and follow-ups. This helps with maintaining a steady flow of clients and ensuring your business continues to grow.


Long-Term Growth: While these figures provide a solid foundation, your earning potential can increase over time as you gain more experience, build a strong client base, and potentially expand your service offerings. Although hiring additional artists isn’t the focus of this course, it’s worth noting that scaling your business is a possibility in the future, leading to even higher income levels.


Indicative Averages: Keep in mind that these calculations are not perfect—they're indicative of an average week once you have the system up and running. In the beginning, you may actually earn more per week as you’ll primarily be working with first-time clients. After about 6 weeks, the touch-up appointments will start rolling in, which will impact your scheduling.

For this reason, I advise against overspending on ads or overbooking yourself, especially in the beginning. Aim to maintain a consistent balance of consultations, first-time appointments, and touch-ups. This balance will help you manage your workload effectively and sustain long-term growth.

Summary
SO! To hit our goal of 5k+ per month you need 4 FTAs (First-Time Appointments) + 4 TUs (Touch Ups) and you need room for 4 or more consultations.
Let’s say you book 80% of your consultations once you get used to them. That means you’re booking 4 / 5 consultations. So you need at least 5 consultations per week to hit the goal of 4 FTAs per week. 
How are we going to get 5 consultations a week?
It’s actually pretty easy with 🌈  paid advertising 🌈
We spend around €15/ day on paid advertising on facebook and we are getting between 3 - 7 requests from clients EVERY SINGLE DAY. Including weekends. That’s 21 - 49 requests per week!
And from those, you only need to book 4 per week to be hitting your 5k goals.
So take a breath 
and let’s get a few things ready before we show you how to do that.

2. Lay the Foundations
Pre-Requisites for Success


Warning! This course is NOT a comprehensive guide to running an entire business and as such there are some areas that will not be covered in this course but are necessary to run your business effectively.


Below is a non-exhaustive list of things you should already have at this point in order to maximize your chances of successfully reaching your income goals :
Basic PMU certification and some initial experience
Existing portfolio of high quality work (At least 5 examples is preferred)
Basic social media presence (e.g., Instagram, Facebook)
Facebook / Meta ad account Setup [Link]
Legal and business setup (licenses, insurance, banking etc.)
Necessary PMU equipment and supplies
PMU Studio**
Some $$$ for ads
*You DO NOT NEED to have a website for this strategy to work. Having a website can be beneficial but that is not what this course is about. If you don’t know how to make one or you don’t have the funds to pay someone to do so it is not a problem. At Motiv Ink Beauty we have not opted to build a website at this stage.

**PMU Studio - This can be a spare room in your house if that’s all you have access to but if possible I would recommend moving to a different location when you can afford it. We started our business from a spare room in our house and have now moved to a studio in a building that offers other beauty services. These businesses synergise with each other and we refer each other to clients all the time. Also if you ever plan on expanding with another staff artist, it's nice to keep that separation from your home.

Analyse your local market potential
Understanding your local market is key to positioning your business effectively and attracting the right clients. For example, we’re based in Limassol which is a city with around 200,000 people. If you are in a much bigger or much smaller city you may have widely varying results depending on the local competition.

Here’s some questions you should be able to answer:

- What is the population size of your local area?
- What is the size of your potential target audience? (check with the meta ads platform)
- Who are your top 5 competitors and what are they doing?
Population Size: Start by doing a simple Google search to find out how many people live in your town or city. For reference, Limassol has a population of roughly 200,000 people. This gives you a general idea of the potential market size in your area.


Target Audience Size: From our experience at Motiv Ink Beauty, we’ve found the most success targeting our ads to women aged 35+. A demographic that typically has more disposable income to spend on premium beauty services like PMU. Use Meta Ads Manager [https://adsmanager.facebook.com/] to check the audience size for this specific segment in your area. For us, this target audience shows around 65,000 people within a 12 km radius. 


Competitor Analysis: Your next task is to research at least 5 competitors—ideally more. Start by stalking them on social media. Social media is one of the cornerstones of any beauty business, so you need to see what’s working for them. Model the best of them—take screenshots, save posts, follow their accounts, and take inspiration for your own work. Notice how they engage with their audience, what types of content get the most interaction, and what promotions they run.

🗹 Research 5+ OF THE BEST local competitors in your area. Stalk them on instagram. See how they present themselves.


Balancing Data with Intuition: While data is important, don’t underestimate the value of local knowledge and intuition. Pay attention to the trends and clientele in your neighborhood. Sometimes, the best insights come from simply observing and engaging with the community around you.
Take action on these steps, and you’ll be better equipped to tailor your services and marketing efforts to meet the needs of your target audience, ensuring a stronger foundation for your business.

Find your Niche
To stand out in the competitive PMU market, you MAY want to define your niche and position yourself effectively. Your niche is where your skills, market demand, and personal interests intersect, and your positioning is how you communicate your unique value to potential clients.

1. Defining Your Niche
Choosing the right niche is a balancing act between what you’re passionate about, where your skills shine, and what the market needs. Here’s how to narrow it down:
Assess Your Skills: Start by evaluating your current strengths. Are you particularly skilled at microblading, powder brows, combo brows, or perhaps scalp micropigmentation? Consider the types of services you enjoy offering the most and where you can consistently deliver high-quality results.


🗹 Research Market Demand
 Look at the competitors you’ve already analyzed. What services are they offering? Are there gaps in the market that you could fill? What are they charging?

For example, if most local PMU artists are focusing on standard microblading, you might carve out a niche in more specialized areas like combo brows or scalp micropigmentation.

🗹 List out your top 3 skills, the services you most enjoy providing, and any market gaps you’ve identified. 
Use this list to brainstorm potential niches that align with both your strengths and market demand.
Example
Top Skills: Microblading, Powder Brows, Scalp Micropigmentation.
Services Enjoyed: Creating natural-looking brows with powder technique.
Market Gaps: Lack of specialists offering combo brows in my area.
Potential Niche: Focusing on combo brows and powder brows for women.

Follow Your Passion: Don’t overlook what excites you. If you’re passionate about a specific aspect of PMU, that enthusiasm will show in your work and attract clients who resonate with your style. Remember, your niche should be something you’re eager to improve and refine over time.

Positioning Strategy
Once you’ve identified your niche, the next step is to position yourself as the go-to expert in that area. This is where crafting your message comes into play.
Crafting Your Message: 
Your message is how you communicate what makes you unique and why clients should choose you over others. It’s the foundation of all your marketing efforts, from your social media bios to your website content. A clear and compelling message helps potential clients understand exactly what you offer and why it’s perfect for them.
🗹 Write Your Positioning Statement: Your positioning statement is a concise summary that captures your niche, the benefits you offer, and your target audience. This statement will guide all your marketing efforts.
Example:
“I specialize in combo brows and powder brows, offering natural-looking, long-lasting results for women aged 35+, ensuring every client leaves with beautifully enhanced brows that complement their natural features.”
Branding Consistency: Ensure that all your branding—from your logo to your social media posts—reflects your niche. For example, if you’re positioning yourself as a scalp micropigmentation specialist for men, your branding will look very different than if you’re focusing on ladies combo brows. 
Pricing Strategy: Your pricing should reinforce your positioning. If you’re offering a specialized service, don’t be afraid to charge a premium. This not only reflects the value of your expertise but also attracts clients who are willing to invest in high-quality results.
By defining your niche and positioning yourself strategically, you’ll attract the right clients and build a reputation as an expert in your field.
Example:
At Motiv Ink Beauty we focus mostly on microblading, powder brows and combo brows. 

When we first started we were charging €200 for new brows and €50 for touch ups.
We’ve now increased those to €250 / €80.

In comparison, we know studios offering scalp micro pigmentation to men for €600 per session as they have positioned themselves as the experts in that area and there is far less competition for that service. 
To-do : 
🗹 Write down the services you will offer and the associated pricing for each service including any touch ups.
🗹 Estimate roughly how long each procedure will take you to perform so you can understand your hourly rates.

Understanding your hourly rates is important because that will be the number you’ll look to increase in the long run. And that’s how you should be valuing your time.
If clients are missing appointments, it’s costing you money. 


If your appointment takes 5 hours instead of 3 because you haven’t practiced enough, it’s costing you money.


If you spend 15 hours editing a picture instead of 1 because you are a perfectionist, 
(real example) it’s costing you money.


Building your brand and online presence
In the PMU business, your online presence plays an important role in converting warm leads into paying clients. While Instagram might not be where you directly find most of your clients, it’s where they’ll go to research you before making a booking. Think of it as a tool for building authority and showing potential clients that you’re the expert they’ve been looking for. Here’s how to make Instagram work effectively for you:
Focus on Instagram
Instagram should be your primary platform for showcasing your work. It’s not just about advertising; it’s about establishing credibility and reducing the risk of cancellations. Here’s what you need to focus on:
Post High-Quality Images and Videos: To build authority, your content needs to meet industry standards. Invest in a decent phone camera to ensure your before-and-after photos are clear, well-lit, and professional. High-quality visuals are essential for demonstrating the quality of your work.


Utilize Auto-Posting Feature: If you’re not actively maintaining your facebook page and you don’t want to start then at least set up your Instagram to automatically post to Facebook. This keeps both platforms active without extra effort on your part, ensuring a consistent online presence. 


Maintain a Professional, Clean, and Active Profile: Your Instagram doesn’t need to be viral, but it does need to look polished and active. Regular posting shows potential clients that you’re engaged and serious about your work. Focus on projecting an image that instills confidence in your expertise.


🗹 Review your Instagram profile with a critical eye. Update your bio to highlight your specialization. Replace any outdated or low-quality images with stronger examples of your work, tips for your audience or other content that would resonate with them.


Model the Best Competitors: Take inspiration from the top competitors you’ve identified during your market research. Look at how they present their work, engage with their audience, and maintain their profiles. Use this as a model to refine your own approach.


Build Your Follower Base: Aim to have at least 500 followers. A solid follower count enhances your credibility and makes potential clients feel more confident in their decision to book with you.


Before-and-After Photos: These are crucial for showcasing the transformations you create. Make sure your photos are clear, well-lit, and professionally presented.


Consider Meta Verified: Another thing you can do as of 2024 is to just pay the subscription fee to become meta verified. It’s just another sub-conscious indicator that you are a real specialist in your field. It’s not a must have but could help your conversion rate. 
 
🗹 Set a goal to reach at least 500 followers. Engage with local accounts, use relevant hashtags, and encourage satisfied clients to follow and tag your work.
If you are far away from this number you can definitely start implementing the rest of this strategy before you’ve hit your goal
By following these steps, you’ll create a strong online presence that builds authority and helps convert warm leads into paying clients. Remember, Instagram is about showcasing your expertise—keep it professional, clean, and active.

3. The PMU Profit System
Converting Cold Paid Ads Traffic into Paying Clients
This section is all about turning potential clients into actual bookings. By strategically using paid advertising, you’ll reach people who may have never heard of your services before and guide them through a process that builds trust and encourages them to book a consultation.
Our goal here is simple: to create a consistent flow of new clients for your PMU business. We’ll achieve this by crafting compelling offers, designing effective ads, and using targeted strategies that make sure your marketing budget is well spent. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid system in place that takes cold traffic (people who don’t know you) and turns them into loyal clients.
Here’s an example of the journey your clients will take :
They see an ad with an offer for your services on facebook. They’ve never heard of you so they ignore it.


Next day, they see it again, they remember you. Now they know who you are.


Next week. They see your retargeting ad. They decide, fuck it. I’ll book a FREE consultation. They send you a message.


You chat with them and book a consultation.


They arrive at the consultation and you make them feel comfortable. They decide to proceed and leave a deposit.


They arrive at the appointment and you give them the best eyebrows they have ever had.


They pay you. They leave a 5* review. You give them a voucher for €10 off their next appointment if they refer a friend.


They book their touch up for 5-6 weeks out.


Now, obviously they’re not all going to go that smoothly but this is just for you to understand the journey they take in their minds with you. 
At first, they don’t know you, they don’t trust you.
Then they know you, but they still don’t trust you.
Then they know you AND they trust you a little bit. enough to leave a deposit.
Then you prove that you’re the expert and now they love you and you should have no problem getting reviews and referrals for all your work.

Now, let’s dive into the first real step: Crafting an Offer.

Crafting an Offer
Creating a strong offer is the first step to attracting potential clients and encouraging them to choose your services. An offer is more than just a discount—it's a strategic tool that adds value, creates urgency, and makes your service irresistible.
Why Is an Offer Important?
In a competitive market, potential clients have plenty of choices. A well-crafted offer cuts through the noise, providing a clear reason for them to act now. It makes your service stand out, adds perceived value, and drives bookings. Without an offer, you're relying on clients to choose based solely on price and reputation, which can be a tougher sell.
How to craft an offer?
When crafting your offer, focus on these key elements:
Define the Service: Choose a high-demand service like microblading that showcases your expertise.


Set an Attractive Price: Offer a compelling discount, such as microblading at €250 instead of €300. Ensure that your offer price doesn’t drop below the minimum pricing you established earlier in the course.


Add Value and Urgency: Strengthen your offer by adding something extra or creating urgency.
Examples :
- For the first 10 customers only
- Free consultations before all appointments
- Free aftercare kit with all appointments

Competitor Research: Learning from Others
Before finalizing your offers, it’s a great idea to spy on your competitors ads and see what they’re offering as well. This will give you insights into what works in your market and help you craft offers that stand out.
Here’s how to do it:
Visit the Meta Ads Library: Go to the Meta Ads Library and select your country.


Search for Competitors: Enter the names of local PMU artists or beauty businesses in your area to see the ads they’re running. If nothing comes up it means they’re not running ads. You can also search for general terms like ‘PMU’ or ‘Microblading’. If nothing is coming up in your area, try searching the USA or UK to get some examples.


Analyze Their Offers: Look at the types of offers your competitors are promoting. Pay attention to the pricing, added value, and urgency in their ads. Take notes on what seems effective and what could be improved.


Use This Information: Apply what you’ve learned to create offers that are competitive but unique to your business. Remember, your offer should stand out without undercutting the value of your services.
🗹 Screenshot 5-10 relevant ads from the meta library and try to work out what makes them appealing : 
	- Why did you choose to pick those ads from the others?
	- What’s the offer?
	- How are they building urgency?
🗹 Create Three Offer Variations

Step 1: Identify the service to promote.

Step 2: Set a compelling price that doesn’t drop below your established minimum.

Step 3: Add value and urgency to encourage quick action.

Step 4: Review competitors’ ads using the Meta Ads Library to ensure your offers stand out.
*TIP* You can use an AI service like chat GPT to generate ideas for offers within your business 
- see video for more info
Example Offers:
Offer 1: Microblading at €250 (normally €300) for the first 10 clients.
Offer 2: Microblading and a free touch-up session for €300, limited to this month.
Offer 3 (Weak Offer Example) : Free aftercare kit with every microblading service. (This offer is weak because it lacks urgency and isn’t compelling enough to drive immediate action.)
By creating multiple offer variations, you’ll have a solid foundation to test and see which resonates most with your audience. Once you’ve crafted your offers, you’re ready to move on to creating the ads that will showcase them effectively.

Designing Ad Variations
Next, we create several ad variations to showcase that offer. But here’s the twist: the Call To Action (CTA)  isn’t about booking the procedure directly. Instead, it’s all about getting them to book a FREE 20-minute consultation. This is a LOW-COMMITMENT step, which converts way better than pushing for appointments right off the bat. During this consultation, we help them figure out which procedure suits them best, whether they’re a good candidate for microblading, and if they need anything like a previous tattoo cover-up. This approach BUILDS TRUST and positions you as the expert.

We’ll focus on creating image ads using THE AIDA FORMAT, which will help guide your messaging. We’ll also cover the best practices for visuals, the importance of testing different variations, and how to set up your ads on Meta’s platform.
Understanding the AIDA Format
AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action. This framework is essential for structuring your ads in a way that captures attention, builds interest, creates desire, and prompts the viewer to take action.
Attention: Your ad must grab the viewer’s attention right away. This is usually done through strong visuals or a bold statement.


Interest: Once you have their attention, build interest by highlighting the benefits of your service.


Desire: Create a strong desire for your service by emphasizing what makes it special and why they need it now.


Action: Finally, prompt the viewer to take action, such as clicking the "Send Message" button. This is your Call to Action (CTA)—the part of the ad where you tell the viewer exactly what to do next.

Key Tips from These Ads:
Simplicity Works: The best ads often have straightforward messaging that clearly explains the offer.


Highlight Benefits: Focus on what the client will gain—like long-lasting results, time savings, or financial savings.


Use Clear CTAs: Always include a clear Call to Action like “Send Message,” which directs potential clients on what to do next.


Localized Appeal: Mention your city or region to make the ad feel relevant and targeted.


Address Their Concerns! : Your customers will always have questions and concerns. If you can address some of them in your ad (e.g. for people worried about the pain, we mention that it only feels like a light scratch) 


Leave Them Wanting More:
Don’t give away all the details in the ad. By providing just enough information, like pricing, you entice clients to interact further to get the full picture. This interaction opens the door for you to build a relationship and guide them towards booking.


Visuals and Messaging: The Key to Effective Ads
Both visuals and messaging are importnant to the success of your ads. Based on our experience at Motiv Ink Beauty, the best-performing ads feature clear before-and-after photos of people who represent your target audience. For example, we’ve found that people respond better when the model in the ad is similar in age to them. Don’t shy away from using older models—older clients often have more disposable income and are a key demographic for PMU services.
Target Audience: In our example we focus on women aged 35+ with no upper age limit. This is where we’ve seen the best results.


Ad Format: We recommend using either square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) image formats, as these tend to perform well in both Facebook and Instagram feeds.


Image Variations: Create multiple ad variations by using different images for each ad. Test different creatives to see which ones resonate best with your audience. For instance, use a before-and-after image of a middle-aged woman in one ad and an older woman in another.


Platform Placement: Run all ads on the Meta Ads platform, but vary the placements between Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed. If you prefer to stick with the recommended strategy, focus primarily on Facebook Feed with an older model. Creating an Instagram Feed variation is optional.


Tools for Creating Ads: Use tools like Canva or Photoshop to design your ads. While the image doesn’t necessarily need text, the visuals should be clear and compelling, showcasing a strong transformation.


🗹 Write out your top 3 benefits and top 3 pains alleviated by your service
🗹 Write out 2-3 ads yourself following the AIDA format

🗹 Create 2-3 good before and after photos showing off your services

[ THE PMU AD GENERATOR ]

Setting Up Your Ad on Meta’s Platform
Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up your ad on Meta’s platform:
Choose Your Offer: 
Select one of the offers you created earlier. Use the same offer for both ad variations.


Log in to Meta Ads Manager:
Click “Create” to start a new campaign.

Choose “Messages” as your campaign objective. This engagement objective is effective for getting potential clients to reach out directly.


Set Your Budget and Schedule:
Start with a budget of €5 per day for each ad campaign. Place different ad tests in their own campaign to keep things simple.

No need to use Facebook Advantage+ targeting or interest targeting. Instead, target people near you within a specific radius.


Set Your Audience Targeting within the Ad Set:
Focus on women aged 35+ in your local area. Use geographic targeting to pinpoint your city or town.


Choose Placements:
 Select “Facebook Feed” as the ONLY placement. Of course you’re free to experiment with others and Facebook will try to encourage you to tick all the platforms and extended network. You want to untick all of these options to start with. Later on when you get the hang of it you can experiment with stories on instagram and see for yourself how they perform. For us they all underperform compared to facebook. For you, depending on your target audience, they may work better.


Upload Your Ad Creative:
Upload the images you’ve created and enter your ad copy. Remember, the CTA should be “Send Message.”


Write the Ad:
Use the method we’ve mentioned above to write your ads. You can use emojis if you like, no need to go overboard with them, again over time you will learn what your audience likes and dislikes.


Name Your Campaigns, Ad Sets, and Ads:
Naming will help in the long run for you to be able to manage your ads effectively. Use clear, descriptive names like “Microblading FB Feed Women 35+” for campaigns, “Older Model” for ad sets, and “Before/After 1” for individual ads.


Add your Messaging Template at the ad level
These templates can be saved and re-used across multiple ads. Make sure the content of the message template corresponds with what's in the ad. For example, if you have an offer with 20 limited spots, an option in your messaging template could be

Message Templates
When a potential client clicks the “Send Message” button on your ad, it opens a chat window that can be pre-filled with message templates. This first interaction is essential—it sets the tone for the conversation and helps guide the client toward booking a consultation. An effective message template makes it easy for clients to take that next step and opens the door for further communication.

Why Message Templates Matter
Message templates serve multiple purposes:
Create a Professional Impression: They help you make a positive and welcoming first impression.


Streamline Communication: Clients can choose from pre-set questions or statements, which helps direct the conversation efficiently.





Designing Your Message Template
Here’s how to create a message template that drives engagement:
Start with a Friendly Greeting:
Begin with a welcoming message that sets a positive tone.
Example: “Hi! Please let us know how we can help you.”


Offer Relevant Quick-Reply Options for them to select:
Provide quick-reply options that address common client needs, such as booking a consultation, asking about your location, or inquiring about the service.

Example Options:
"I'm interested, can I book a free consultation?"
"Where is your studio located?"
“Hi, are there any spaces available?”


Include Multiple Languages (if applicable):
If your audience is multilingual, offer the same options in both English and the local language.


Guide the Conversation:
While your ad may promote an appointment, your primary goal at this stage is to book a consultation. The template should encourage this step, leaving some details for the conversation to maintain interest.

For example, after selecting "I'm interested, can I book a free consultation?", follow up by asking for their preferred date and time.


Set Up an Autoresponder:
You can also set up an autoresponder in Meta Business Suite to automatically reply to common questions. This ensures quick responses even when you’re not immediately available.


Importance of Quick Replies:
Quick replies are vital for maintaining client interest. The faster you respond, the higher your chances of securing a consultation. Make sure to turn on message notifications in the Meta Business Suite app on your phone so you can reply promptly.

** Top Tip - Write your FAQs**
You should also have a small library of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers. 

When people reach out to you either through comments, messages or even calls it helps to have a set of answers you can quickly and easily refer to. This is also great if you ever intend to hire someone in the future to handle these communications as this will act as a kind of Knowledge Base for them to use as well.

Implementing a Retargeting Campaign
While your initial ads are running, it’s essential to set up a retargeting campaign with a second offer. This new ad will target anyone who engaged with your first ads, keeping your brand in front of people who’ve already shown interest. Retargeting is highly effective because it helps you stay top of mind, gradually guiding these warm leads towards booking a consultation. By framing your second offer differently—without necessarily making it cheaper—you can re-engage these potential clients and increase your conversion rates.

Why Retargeting is Effective
When someone interacts with your initial ad—by clicking, liking, commenting, or even just viewing it—they’re signaling an interest in your services. However, most people need to see an ad multiple times before they decide to take action. Retargeting allows you to reintroduce your offer to these warm leads, giving them another opportunity to book a consultation.
Retargeting campaigns are particularly effective because they focus on a small, already-engaged audience. This approach is more cost-efficient and has a higher likelihood of converting leads compared to targeting cold traffic.

Setting Up a Retargeting Campaign on Meta Ads Platform


Create a Custom Audience:
In Meta Ads Manager, go to the “Audiences” section. Click on “Create Audience” and select “Custom Audience.”
Choose “Engagement” as the source, targeting people who interacted with your Facebook or Instagram ads within the last 365 days.
Name your audience something descriptive, like “Retargeting – Engaged 365 Days,” for easy reference later.


Start a New Campaign:
In Meta Ads Manager, click “Create” to start a new campaign.
Select “Messages” as your campaign objective to drive direct engagement.
Set the Campaign Name: Use a clear name such as “Retargeting – Microblading Offer 2.”
Set the Budget: At the campaign level, set your daily budget to €1 - €1.50 to align with the smaller, focused audience you're targeting.


Configure the Ad Set:
Audience Selection: Under the "Audience" section, choose the custom audience you created earlier (“Retargeting – Engaged 365 Days”).
Set the Ad Set Name: Use a descriptive name like “Engaged 365 Days – Facebook Feed.”
Placements: Under "Placements," choose “Manual Placements” and select Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed, which typically provide the best results.


Design the Retargeting Ad:
Ad Format: Choose either a single image or carousel format. Upload your creative, making sure the visuals are consistent with your original ad for brand recognition, but with a fresh angle in the messaging (e.g., aftercare kits or an extended consultation offer).
Call to Action (CTA): Keep the same CTA as your original ad, such as “Send Message,” for consistency and ease of conversion.
Name Your Ad: Give the ad a descriptive name like “Before/After Image – Offer 2.”
Ad Contents : Use one of the offers we created earlier. Keep it pretty short, they should know who you are by now. 


Review and Publish:
Double-check all your settings at each level—campaign, ad set, and ad. Ensure that your audience, placements, budget, and ad creatives are correct.
Once confirmed, click “Publish” to launch the campaign.


Monitor and Optimize:
After your campaign is live, monitor performance metrics mentioned previously. This retargeting ad will usually have a much higher CTR than the previous ads. If it is not outperforming the top level ads then you should try to create another one and kill this one.


Higher frequency over time (5+) is expected in retargeting since repeated exposure can drive conversions. Make adjustments as needed based on performance.

By carefully setting up your retargeting ads and monitoring their performance, you can maximize the chances of converting warm leads into consultations and, ultimately, paying clients. This approach ensures that your brand remains in front of interested individuals, nudging them toward taking the final step.

Optimizing Ad Campaigns
Running a successful ad campaign isn’t just about setting it up and letting it run. You need to be proactive in optimizing your ads, focusing on what’s working and quickly cutting what’s not. Within 3-4 days, you can usually tell if an ad is effective based on the messages and interactions you’re receiving. Optimization is essential for ensuring your ad budget is spent on campaigns that deliver real results.

Key Metrics to Monitor
When using the ‘Send Message’ CTA—which is central to this system—you may encounter limited reporting data from Meta’s ad platform. However, several other metrics can help you assess the performance of your ads:
Click-Through Rate (CTR):
This metric shows how many people clicked on your ad relative to how many saw it. A low CTR often indicates that your ad isn’t catching attention, and you may need to tweak the visuals or copy.


Engagement Rate:
Engagement includes likes, shares, comments, and interactions. High engagement is usually a positive sign that your ad is resonating with your audience, even if it’s not directly leading to messages.


Cost Per Click (CPC):
This tells you how much you’re paying for each click. If your CPC is too high, you might need to adjust your creative or copy to make it more appealing.



Conversion Rate (Consultations Booked):
Ultimately, the number of consultations booked is your most critical metric. Track how many inquiries from each ad lead to actual bookings. This will help you focus on the ads that are truly driving business.

Common Reasons for Underperforming Ads
If an ad isn’t performing as expected, it’s usually due to one or more of the following issues:
Issue with the Copy: Your ad’s message might not be compelling or clear enough. Review your headline, body text, and CTA to ensure they’re persuasive and aligned with your audience’s needs.


Issue with the Creative: The visuals might not be grabbing attention. Consider using different images or trying a new angle. For example, if one before-and-after photo isn’t working, test a different one or try a video format.


Ineffective Targeting: Although we don’t want to change targeting too much, sometimes narrowing or broadening your audience slightly can make a difference. However, since your targeting is already well-defined, focus more on the ad’s content.


Ineffective Follow-Up: Once potential clients message you, how quickly and effectively you respond will determine how successful you will be. Delays or generic responses can result in lost opportunities. Ensure you’re following up promptly and with personalized messages.


Lack of Trust: If your audience isn’t familiar with your brand, they might hesitate to engage. Building trust can involve showcasing testimonials, highlighting certifications, or ensuring your ads feel personal and authentic.

Steps to Optimize Your Ad Campaigns
Monitor Performance Regularly:
Check your ad’s performance metrics daily during the first few days. Focus on the key metrics mentioned above to identify underperforming ads quickly.


Identify and Address Issues:
If an ad is underperforming, consider which of the above issues might be the cause. Is it the copy, the creative, or something else? Make adjustments accordingly.


Test Ad Variations:
Creative: Swap out images or try a different visual approach. Keep the messaging consistent with your brand.
Copy: Refine your headlines, descriptions, and CTAs. Ensure that your message is clear, compelling, and speaks directly to your audience’s pain points and desires.


Reallocate Budget:
Shift more of your budget toward high-performing ads and reduce or pause spending on those that aren’t delivering results. This allows you to maximize ROI by focusing on what works.


Be Analytical and Adapt:
Optimization is about being smart and analytical. Review the data, identify trends, and be willing to make changes based on what you learn. Remember, even small tweaks can make a significant difference in performance.
By staying focused on these core areas—creative, copy, targeting, follow-up, and trust—you can refine your campaigns to ensure they deliver the best possible results. Being analytical and adaptable is key to successful ad optimization, helping you get the most out of your ad budget while driving consistent conversions.
🗹 Monitor all ads performance using the metrics we identified and kill non-performers. Replace them with new variations until you find a format that works.

Managing Incoming Messages
Once your ads start generating interest, you’ll find that messages begin rolling in. At this stage, the primary goal is to book consultations as quickly as possible. Fast responses are essential—studies show that your chances of securing a booking drop significantly the longer you wait to reply.

The Importance of Quick Responses
Responding promptly to inquiries will help massively with converting interest into consultations. Research indicates that the likelihood of converting a lead into a client decreases by 10 times after the first 5 minutes, and businesses that respond within the first hour are 7 times more likely to have meaningful conversations. The faster you can reply, the higher your chances of securing that all-important consultation.
Pro Tip: Turn on message notifications using the Meta Business Suite app on your phone. This ensures you’re alerted immediately when someone sends you a message, allowing you to respond quickly.

Balancing Automation and Personal Interaction
While automated replies can be useful for handling Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or when you’re unavailable, personal interaction is vital, especially in the early stages. Engaging with potential clients personally allows you to address their specific concerns, build trust, and establish a connection. If you can manage incoming messages without automation, this can lead to a more personalized experience for the client.
Suggested Use of Automation: If you do use automated responses, keep them simple and direct. For example, outside of your regular business hours you could have an automated reply saying, “Thanks for reaching out! I’ll get back to you shortly.” This sets the expectation of a quick follow-up.

Handling Common Objections
During initial conversations, you’ll likely encounter a few common objections or concerns. Here are some examples and how you might handle them:
Price Concerns:
Client: “€250 seems expensive for microblading.”
Response: “I completely understand. My pricing reflects the high quality of the service and the lasting results you’ll enjoy. Plus, it includes a free consultation and aftercare kit to ensure your brows heal perfectly.”


Pain or Discomfort:
Client: “I’m worried that microblading will be painful.”
Response: “It’s a common concern! Most of my clients describe the sensation as similar to a light scratch. I also use a numbing cream to ensure you’re as comfortable as possible during the procedure.”


Results Longevity:
Client: “How long will the results last?”
Response: “Results typically last up to two years, depending on your skin type and aftercare. We’ll go over all the details during your free consultation to make sure you get the best possible outcome.”


Previous Bad Experiences:
Client: “I’ve had a bad experience with microblading before.”
Response: “I’m sorry to hear that. Every artist has a different approach, and I take extra care to ensure each client gets the results they want. Let’s discuss what didn’t work for you last time, and we can tailor the service to meet your expectations.”
Understanding these objections and preparing thoughtful, reassuring responses can significantly improve your ability to convert inquiries into bookings.

Follow-Up Strategy
Not every potential client will book a consultation immediately. For those who express interest but don’t follow through right away, a gentle follow-up can make all the difference.
Suggested Follow-Up Approach: Reach out once a week to those who didn’t respond or didn’t book a consultation. Keep the tone friendly and non-pushy, offering to answer any additional questions they might have. For example:


Message: “Hi [Name], I just wanted to check in and see if you had any more questions about the microblading service. I’d love to help you achieve your perfect brows—let me know if you’re still interested in booking a free consultation!”
Limit follow-ups to two or three messages over a few weeks. This keeps your business on their radar without being intrusive.

Leveraging FAQs for Faster Responses
Having the list of FAQs that you created earlier on hand can speed up your response times. While each client interaction should feel personalized, being able to quickly address common questions will help you manage multiple conversations efficiently. Consider keeping a reference document with polished responses to common questions, so you can copy, paste, and tweak as needed.
By managing incoming messages effectively—responding quickly, handling objections skillfully, and following up thoughtfully—you can maximize your chances of turning inquiries into consultations and, ultimately, into loyal clients.

Conducting Consultations
The consultation is where the magic happens—this is your opportunity to educate the client, assess if they’re a good fit for the procedure, and, most importantly, secure a deposit to lock in the booking. Successful consultations are the key to high conversion rates, and they play a significant role in reducing no-show rates for the actual appointment.

Building Trust During the Consultation
Trust is the cornerstone of a successful consultation. Clients need to feel confident not only in your skills but also in your ability to understand their needs and concerns. Here’s how to build trust effectively:
Personal Rapport: Start by establishing a personal connection. Greet them warmly, ask about their day, and show genuine interest in their expectations for the procedure. People are more likely to book with someone they feel comfortable with.


Show Expertise: Explain the procedure in detail, using clear and simple language. Discuss what they can expect before, during, and after the procedure. Share examples of past work, including before-and-after photos of clients with similar features or concerns. This not only demonstrates your expertise but also helps them visualize the results.

Handling Unsuitable Candidates
Not every client will be an ideal candidate for the procedure. If a client isn’t suitable due to a previous permanent tattoo that needs removal, it’s important to handle this delicately:
Run the Consultation Anyway: Even if the client needs to take an additional step, like getting a previous tattoo removed, conduct the consultation as usual. This shows your commitment to their best interests and keeps them engaged with your service.


Referral Strategy: Recommend a trusted laser removal specialist and explain the benefits of starting with a clean slate. Let them know you’ll be ready to help as soon as they’ve completed the removal process. Encourage them to stay in touch and book a follow-up consultation once they’re ready.


Reassurance: Reassure them that taking this step will ultimately lead to better, longer-lasting results. This helps maintain their interest and keeps you top of mind when they’re ready to proceed.

Securing a Deposit
Securing a deposit during the consultation is crucial for reducing no-show rates. Without a deposit, you risk clients booking an appointment and not showing up, which can be a significant drain on your time and resources. Here’s how to ensure clients feel comfortable leaving a deposit:
Explain the Importance: Let the client know that the deposit is a standard practice to reserve their appointment slot. Emphasize that this also benefits them by guaranteeing their spot, especially if you have a busy schedule.


Deposit Amount: We recommend asking for a deposit of at least €50. While some professionals request up to half the procedure cost, starting with €50 strikes a balance—it’s enough to secure commitment without scaring clients off. Even after increasing prices, we’ve found this amount to be effective.


Reassurance: Reassure them that the deposit will be deducted from their final bill. Explain your cancellation policy clearly, so they understand the conditions under which the deposit might be non-refundable. Transparency here helps build trust.


Payment Options: Make it easy for them to pay the deposit by offering multiple payment options, such as credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or online payment services. The easier you make it for them, the more likely they are to follow through.

Structuring the Consultation
A well-structured consultation not only builds trust but also ensures you address all the client’s concerns, making them feel informed and comfortable. Here’s a loose framework to guide your consultations:
Introduction:
Start with a warm greeting and introduce yourself.
Ask the client about their expectations and what they hope to achieve with the procedure.


Client Questions and Objections:
Encourage the client to ask questions. Address their concerns honestly and thoroughly.
Be prepared to handle common objections, such as concerns about pain, pricing, and results longevity.


Detailed Explanation:
Walk the client through the procedure step by step. Use visual aids like before-and-after photos to illustrate your points.
Explain what they can expect before, during, and after the procedure, including any aftercare requirements.


Assess Suitability:
Evaluate the client’s suitability for the procedure. If they have any issues like a previous tattoo, discuss the next steps, such as laser removal.


Close with the Deposit:
Once the client is satisfied with the information, discuss booking the appointment. Explain the deposit process and why it’s important.
Secure the deposit before concluding the consultation.


Next Steps:
Confirm the appointment details, including date, time, and any pre-procedure instructions.
Offer them a way to easily contact you if they have more questions.
By following this structure, you can ensure that your consultations are thorough, professional, and effective in securing bookings. And for even more detailed strategies, don’t forget to check out our Consultation Success Blueprint.

Booking Confirmations & Reminders
Once your consultation is complete and the deposit is secured, the next step is to confirm the booking and ensure that your client is fully prepared for their appointment. Effective communication at this stage helps to build a stronger relationship, reduce no-shows, and ensure a smooth appointment process.

Confirming the Booking
After the consultation, it’s important to confirm the booking as soon as possible. Here’s how to do it effectively:
Shift to Text Messaging or Phone Calls:
Transition the communication from platforms like Facebook to text messaging or phone calls. This personal touch not only solidifies the relationship but also makes the interaction feel more direct and trustworthy.
Example Text:
“Hi [Client’s Name], your appointment for [Service Name] is confirmed for [Date] at [Time]. The location is [Studio Address]. Please save this information and add it to your calendar. Looking forward to seeing you!”
Include Important Details:
In your confirmation message, always include the date, time, and location of the appointment. This reduces the chances of any confusion.
Instructions: If there are any pre-appointment instructions (e.g., avoid caffeine, alcohol, and painkillers 24 hours before the appointment), include them in the confirmation. This ensures the client is well-prepared.


Reminding Clients (1 Day / 7 Day)
Reminders help keep your schedule intact and minimize no-shows. Here’s how to manage reminders effectively:
Send a Reminder the Day Before:
A text message or call the day before the appointment is essential to confirm that the client is still on board. This gives them a final chance to reschedule if something has come up, and it also allows you to address any last-minute concerns.
Example Reminder Text / Call :
“Hi [Client’s Name], just a reminder about your appointment tomorrow at [Time]. Please remember to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and painkillers today. Looking forward to seeing you!”

Send a Reminder a Week Before (for Long-Term Bookings):
If the booking is more than a month away, send a reminder a week before the appointment. This helps to ensure the client hasn’t forgotten and allows for rescheduling if needed.
Example Long-Term Reminder Text:
“Hi [Client’s Name], just a friendly reminder about your upcoming appointment next week on [Date]. Please let me know if anything has changed.”

By combining booking confirmations with timely reminders, you can significantly reduce no-shows and cancellations, ensuring that your appointment schedule runs smoothly. This approach also helps reinforce your professionalism and commitment to providing an excellent client experience.
🗹 Create 3 template messages that you can re-use: 
	- Booking Confirmation (Immediately after consultation)
	- 1 Week to appointment Reminder
	- 1 Day to appointment Reminder

Managing Cancellations & No-Shows
Cancellations and no-shows are an inevitable part of running a service-based business, but how you handle them can significantly impact your schedule, income, and overall stress levels. Here’s how to manage these situations effectively, maintaining both your professionalism and your self-respect.
Cancellations With More Than 24 Hours Notice
When a client cancels with more than 24 hours notice, it’s less disruptive, and there’s usually still time to fill the slot. Here’s how to approach these cancellations:
Offer to Reschedule:
Start by offering the client the option to reschedule. This keeps the door open and shows that you’re flexible and accommodating.
Example Response: “I’m sorry to hear you can’t make it! Would you like to reschedule your appointment? I’m happy to find a time that works better for you.”


Follow Up Later If They’re Unsure:
If the client isn’t sure about their availability, suggest checking back in a month. This gives them time to figure out their schedule and keeps you in their mind.
Example Response: “No worries, I understand! How about I check back with you in a month to see if we can find a time that works?”


Let Them Go If They Insist on Canceling:
If the client insists on canceling and isn’t interested in rescheduling, let it go. There’s no need to dwell on a lost booking; instead, focus on filling that spot with a new client.
Mindset Tip: Remember, there are plenty more fish in the sea. Don’t stress over one cancellation—use the opportunity to bring in a new client who values your time.
Cancellations Within 24 Hours Notice and No-Shows
Last-minute cancellations and no-shows are more problematic as they can disrupt your day and lead to lost income. Here’s how to handle these situations:
Assess the Situation:
When a client cancels within the 24-hour notice period, or doesn’t show up at all, take a moment to assess the situation. Consider their reason for canceling and whether you believe it’s valid.


Offer to Reschedule Once (If You Believe Their Excuse):
If you believe the client’s excuse and they still want to proceed with the service, you can offer to reschedule once. However, this should be at your discretion, and you should make it clear that this is a one-time accommodation.
Example Response: “I understand things come up. I can offer to reschedule this time, but please note that due to the late notice, I can only extend this courtesy once.”


Stand Firm on Your Policy:
Make it clear from the beginning that you have a firm policy regarding cancellations and no-shows. When taking the deposit, explain that one missed appointment is the limit—if they miss a second, they will not be allowed to rebook.
Example Policy: “To secure your appointment, I require a €50 deposit. Please note that if you miss your appointment or cancel within 24 hours more than once, I won’t be able to book you again. This policy helps ensure that all clients receive the best service possible.”


Know Your Worth:
It’s essential to maintain your self-respect and enforce your policies. If a client misses a second appointment or repeatedly disrespects your time, don’t rebook them. They’ve shown that they don’t value your time, and you have the right to choose not to work with them.


Mindset Tip: Remember, you run your own business now, and you don’t have to tolerate disrespect or unreliability from clients. Your time is valuable, and your policies are in place to protect both your business and your well-being.
By handling cancellations and no-shows with a clear policy and a firm yet understanding approach, you can minimize their impact on your business. Remember to stay focused on filling your schedule with clients who value your time and services.
🗹 Write a deposit / cancellation policy and have a strategy in mind to deal with no-shows and late cancellations.

PMU Sessions and Photography
The actual PMU session is where your skills and professionalism take center stage. This is your opportunity to deliver outstanding results that not only satisfy your client but also create a powerful visual testament to your expertise. Photography plays a critical role in this process—capturing the transformation not only delights your client but also serves as essential content for your marketing efforts.
Delivering Exceptional Results
First and foremost, focus on delivering the best results you can during the PMU session. Your expertise, attention to detail, and commitment to client satisfaction will shine through in the final outcome.
Preparation: Ensure all your equipment is sterilized and organized before the client arrives. Review the client’s consultation notes to remind yourself of their specific needs and expectations.


Communication: Throughout the session, keep the client informed about what you’re doing and why. This helps to reassure them and builds trust in your expertise.


Consent Forms: Make sure all necessary consent forms are completed and signed before beginning the procedure. This is an important  step for both legal protection and ensuring the client is fully informed.

Importance of Photography in PMU
Photography isn’t just about documenting your work—it’s a critical marketing tool that helps you attract new clients and build your brand. Here’s how to make the most of it:
Before and After Photos:
Angles: Always take before and after photos from both face-on and 3/4 angle shots. These angles are the most flattering and provide a clear view of the transformation.
Consistency: Ensure the lighting, angle, and position are consistent in both the before and after photos. This consistency makes the transformation more apparent and professional.


Slow Panning Videos:
Slow panning videos are excellent for social media. They show the detail and precision of your work in a dynamic way that static photos can’t capture.
Technique: Start with a close-up of the brow, then slowly pan out to reveal the full face. This gives viewers a complete view of the results and is particularly effective for platforms like Instagram.


Client Selfies:
Encourage your client to take a few selfies with your phone after the session. These candid shots can be gold for your content, as they show the client’s immediate satisfaction and excitement.
Sharing: With the client’s permission, these selfies can be shared on your social media platforms. They add an authentic, personal touch to your online presence.


Photo Quality:
The quality of your photos is critical. You don’t need a professional camera—many smartphones have excellent cameras that are more than capable. However, make sure your photos are well-lit and clear.
Lighting: Natural light is best, but if that’s not available, invest in a ring light or other professional lighting to ensure your photos look sharp and professional.


Content for Future Use:
Organize Your Photos: Create a system for storing and organizing your photos so you can easily find them when needed for marketing purposes.
Content Planning: Use these photos for future content and ads. Regularly post before and after images on your social media channels, feature them in your ads, and use them to build a portfolio on your website.
Building Your Photography Skills
As a PMU artist, photography is one of your business cornerstones. The better your photos, the more compelling your marketing will be. Here are a few tips to brush up on your photography skills:
Practice: Like any skill, photography improves with practice. Spend time experimenting with different angles, lighting setups, and backgrounds to see what works best for your work.


Learn Basics: Understanding the basics of composition, lighting, and even a bit of photo editing can go a long way in improving the quality of your images.


Editing: Use simple editing tools or apps to enhance your photos if needed. Small adjustments in brightness, contrast, or sharpness can make a big difference.
By delivering exceptional results during your PMU sessions and capturing them effectively through photography, you’ll not only satisfy your clients but also create a visual portfolio that speaks volumes about your skills and professionalism. This visual content will be a powerful tool in attracting new clients and growing your business.
🗹 Find 5-10 examples of photograph styles that you like to reference when it comes to taking your own client pictures.

Payments, Reviews, and Referrals
Once the PMU session is complete and your client is delighted with their new look, it’s time to wrap things up professionally—this includes handling payment, encouraging reviews, and setting the stage for future referrals.
Processing Payment
Getting paid promptly and smoothly is essential for maintaining your business’ cash flow and ensuring a professional experience for your clients. Here’s how to handle payments effectively:
Multiple Payment Options:
Offer a variety of payment options to make it as convenient as possible for the client. This can include cash, credit/debit cards, bank transfers, or mobile payment services like PayPal or Apple Pay.
Example: “I can accept payment via card, bank transfer, or PayPal—whichever is easiest for you!”


Confirming the Transaction:
Once the payment is processed, provide a receipt, either in print or via email. This adds a layer of professionalism and reassures the client that everything is in order.
Encouraging Reviews
Google reviews are a powerful tool for building your online presence and attracting new clients. Positive reviews not only boost your visibility but also establish credibility with potential clients who may be researching your services.
Ask for a Review Immediately:
The best time to ask for a review is when the client is still thrilled with their results. Hand them a scannable QR code that links directly to your Google Business Reviews page, making it easy for them to leave feedback on the spot.
Example Request: “I’m so glad you love your new brows! It would mean a lot to me if you could leave a quick review—just scan this QR code, and it’ll take you directly to my Google Reviews page.”


Follow-Up Review Request:
When you confirm their touch-up appointment via text, include the review link again. This gentle reminder can encourage clients who didn’t leave a review initially to do so later.
Example Text Reminder: “Looking forward to seeing you for your touch-up in a few weeks! If you haven’t had a chance yet, I’d really appreciate it if you could leave a review—it helps others find me too. Here’s the link: [Insert Review Link].”
🗹 Set up your Google Business Page and create a QR code from the Review link that you can share with your clients. 

Encouraging Referrals
Referrals are a highly effective way to grow your business. Clients who are happy with your work are often eager to recommend you to friends and family, especially if there’s an incentive involved.
Referral Voucher:
Offer a referral voucher as a thank-you to clients who bring in new business. A typical offer might be €10 off their next appointment and €10 off for their friends when they refer a friend.
Example Offer: “For every friend you refer who books an appointment, you’ll both €10 off your next visit. Here’s a voucher to share!”


Make It Easy to Share:
Provide physical vouchers or digital codes that clients can easily share with friends and family. Make sure the referral process is straightforward, so clients feel encouraged to participate.
Example Referral Method: “Just have your friend mention your name when they book, or share this code with them!”

Before they leave, schedule their touch-up for about 5-6 weeks out and remind them as the date approaches. Your PRICING STRATEGY should dictate how much effort you put into touch-ups. If you’re fully booked, it might make sense to have someone else handle these at a flat fee, leaving you free to focus on new clients.
🗹 Create a referral voucher (you can use Canva) and then print off at least 50 vouchers to share with happy clients



Scheduling and Managing Touch-Ups
Touch-ups are an essential part of the PMU process and should be scheduled before the client leaves their initial appointment.
Scheduling the Touch-Up:
Ideally, schedule the touch-up for about 5-6 weeks after the initial procedure. This timing allows the brows to heal properly while ensuring the client doesn’t forget.
Example Scheduling: “Let’s go ahead and schedule your touch-up for about six weeks from now. How does [Date] at [Time] work for you?”


Pricing Strategy:
Your pricing strategy should dictate how you handle touch-ups. If you’re fully booked and touch-ups are taking up too much of your time, consider outsourcing them at a flat fee. This allows you to focus on new clients while still providing necessary aftercare.


Reminder for Touch-Ups:
Send a reminder a week before the touch-up appointment to ensure the client is still on board. This is also an excellent opportunity to confirm any final details or answer last-minute questions.
Example Reminder: “Just a reminder that your touch-up is coming up next week on [Date] at [Time]. Looking forward to seeing you then!”
By managing payments, reviews, and referrals effectively, you not only ensure a smooth client experience but also lay the groundwork for future business. This approach will help you build a strong reputation, attract new clients, and maintain a steady stream of income.

Offering Yearly Touch-Ups
Keeping the client relationship strong even after the initial procedure is important for long-term business success. Yearly touch-ups not only maintain the client’s results but also provide a consistent stream of repeat business with minimal effort.
How to Offer Yearly Touch-Ups
Timing the Offer:
Around the 12-month mark, reach out to your clients to remind them that it’s time for a touch-up. This is typically when the pigment starts to fade, and they may be noticing the need for a refresh.
Example Call/Text: “Hi [Client’s Name], it’s been about a year since your last microblading session! I just wanted to check in with you to see how your eyebrows are holding up and see if you need a touch up? I have a special offer on yearly touch ups for only ______ at the moment if you’re interested.


Offer a Discount:
Offering a discount of 25%-40% off the full microblading price makes the touch-up more appealing and encourages clients to book. It’s a win-win situation—you secure repeat business, and they get to maintain their look at a reduced cost.


After 1.5 Years—Treat as a New Procedure:
If a client waits longer than 1.5 years for a touch-up, the procedure should be treated as new. The pigment may have faded significantly, and you’ll likely need to spend more time reworking the brows. Charge accordingly to reflect the additional work involved.
Example Approach: “If it’s been more than 1.5 years since your last touch-up, we’ll need to treat it as a new procedure. This ensures you get the best results. Let’s book you in for a full session.”


The Benefits of Offering Yearly Touch-Ups
Client Retention: Offering yearly touch-ups keeps clients coming back, ensuring that they don’t seek out another artist when their brows need refreshing.


Consistent Revenue: Touch-ups are a steady source of income with minimal marketing effort. Once you establish a routine with your clients, these appointments can fill your schedule year after year.


Long-Term Relationships: Regular touch-ups help build a lasting relationship with your clients, making them more likely to refer friends and family to your services.

Staying Organized
Staying organized is the backbone of a successful PMU business. With a full calendar of appointments, follow-ups, and marketing tasks, effective organization ensures that everything runs smoothly, allowing you to focus on what you do best—creating beautiful brows.
Key Strategies for Staying Organized
Use a Calendar System:
A reliable calendar system is non-negotiable. Whether you prefer a digital calendar like Google Calendar or a physical planner, make sure every appointment, follow-up, and task is logged. Set reminders for key actions, such as sending out appointment reminders or following up with leads.
Tip: Color-code your calendar for different types of tasks—appointments, follow-ups, marketing, etc.—to make it easier to see what’s coming up at a glance.


Organize Client Information:
Keep detailed records of each client, including their contact information, appointment history, and notes from consultations. This helps you personalize your interactions and ensures you don’t miss any important details.


Manage Your Content Library:
Your photos and videos are valuable assets. Organize them into folders by client, date, or procedure type, so you can quickly find what you need when creating content or ads.


Streamline Communication:
Use templates for common communications, such as appointment confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups. This saves time and ensures consistency in your messaging.


Set Aside Time for Admin Work:
Dedicate specific blocks of time each week to handle administrative tasks like scheduling, billing, and content creation. By setting aside this time, you avoid the overwhelm of trying to fit admin work around your appointments.
Tip: Consider using the first hour of your day for admin tasks, so you start your day organized and on top of your workload.


Know When to Outsource:
As your business grows, consider outsourcing some tasks, such as social media management, bookkeeping, or even hiring an assistant to help with scheduling. This allows you to focus more on your clients and less on the behind-the-scenes work.
Mindset Tip: Outsourcing isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s a strategic move that can free up your time to do what you’re best at and grow your business further.
By staying organized, you’ll be able to handle the demands of a growing business with ease. This not only helps you maintain a high level of professionalism but also allows you to deliver consistently excellent service to your clients.
