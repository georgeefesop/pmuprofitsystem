# PMU Profit System

A complete system to help PMU artists reach â‚¬5,000/month with marketing tools, consultation frameworks, and business strategies.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running with HTTPS (Required for Stripe Payments)

Stripe requires a secure connection (HTTPS) for payment forms to work properly. To run the application locally with HTTPS:

### Option 1: Using mkcert (Recommended)

1. Install mkcert:
   ```bash
   # On Windows (with chocolatey)
   choco install mkcert

   # On macOS (with homebrew)
   brew install mkcert
   ```

2. Set up mkcert:
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   ```

3. Generate certificates for localhost:
   ```bash
   mkcert localhost
   ```

4. Run the HTTPS server:
   ```bash
   node start-https.js
   ```

5. Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Option 2: Using next-https

1. Install next-https:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev next-https
   # or
   yarn add --dev next-https
   ```

2. Add the following script to your package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev:https": "next-https"
   }
   ```

3. Run the HTTPS server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   # or
   yarn dev:https
   ```

4. Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser.
